I always had this inner image of the year as a circle. This was my first work in information architecture. It was very enlightening for me because i made something visual wich was existing inside of me for so many years. I remember being a child visualizing the earth drawing a circle around the sun. Actually this idea of the year as a circle existed before me and the western culture. It existed even before us humans. Its pure nature -- its real information.
